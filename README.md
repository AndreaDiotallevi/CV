## Andrea Diotallevi

I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in building engineering and architecture, fascinated by how widely code is embedded in almost everything we do, making it ever more efficient and accessible.

After a year and a half of self-study, working on personal side projects like [generative art](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art) and [...], I graduated from Makers Academy, a 16-week software development bootcamp, in which I rapidly increased my skills as a developer using principles such as TDD, DRY, OOP, and XP values and getting hands-on experience in building full stack web apps like [...].

I find fulfillment in solving problems using logical thinking and I am looking forward to take on a career where I can use my analytical mindset and sensibility for clean design to contribute to a meaningful project and expand my knowledge in web development.

## Interests

- **Music**: I have been playing the piano since the age of five and music has always been integral to my life. The habit of practicing and composing pieces of music has tought me how to concentrate for long hours and build a balanced and grounded mindset. In June 2009 I received the piano diploma from the Conservatory of Ancona, Italy
- **Generative Art**: I discovered the field of [generative art](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art) while learning to code on my own and became captivated by this, experimenting with p5.js and processing, and sharing my work on [openprocessing.org](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/157729)
- **Chess**: I enjoy playing chess and following tournaments on-line, as I am fascinated by the math and algorithms hidden within the rules of the game
- **Sports**: I am inspired by sport stories and people, from which I have learned so much in terms of respect, self-esteem and personal development. My favourite sports to watch are rugby and tennis, while to practice are swimming and cycling
