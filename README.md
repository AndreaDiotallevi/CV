## Andrea Diotallevi

I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in building engineering and architecture, fascinated by how widely code is embedded in almost everything we do, making it ever more efficient and accessible.

After a year and a half of self-study, working on exciting side projects like generative art, I graduated from Makers Academy, a 16-week software development bootcamp in which I rapidly increased my skills as a developer using principles such as TDD, DRY, OOP, and XP values.

I find fulfillment in solving problems using logical thinking and I am looking forward to take on a career where I can enjoy my analytical mindset and love for clean design to contribute to a meaningful project and expand my knowledge in web development.
