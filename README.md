## Andrea Diotallevi

I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in building engineering and architecture, fascinated by how widely code is embedded in almost everything we do, making it ever more efficient and accessible.

After a year and a half of self-study working on side projects and different languages, I graduated from the 16-week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy, which rapidly increased my skills as a developer using principles such as TDD, DRY, SRP, and XP values.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy, London (October 2019 - January 2020)

*Full Stack Development*  

- 16 weeks honing my skills as a full-stack software engineer.
- Promoting TDD, DRY, OOP, MVC, clean code, teamwork, respect, mindfulness, and acceptance.
- Time for self-driven work allows us to focus on area we believe we most need improvement, or to pursue interests that may not be part of the standard curriculum.
- Multiple group projects simulate real-world, team-work environments with stand-ups, retros, sprint-planning, task delegation, and most of all thoughtful communication.
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Polytechnic University of Ancona, Italy (September 2008 - December 2014)

- Master's degree in building engineering and architecture (110/110 with honors)

#### Conservatory of Ancona, Italy (March 2002 - June 2009)

- Piano diploma (10/10)

## Experience

**Proctor and Matthews Architects** (March 2015 to September 2019)    
*Architect*  
- I have built python scripts to automate some boring stuff like renaming multiple files with correct revision letter.

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
