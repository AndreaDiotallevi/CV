## Andrea Diotallevi

I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in building engineering and architecture, fascinated by how widely code is embedded in almost everything we do, making it ever more efficient and accessible.

After a year and a half of self-study and working on personal projects like [generative art](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art), I graduated from Makers Academy, a 16-week software development bootcamp, in which I rapidly increased my skills as a developer using principles such as TDD, DRY, OOP, and XP values and getting hands-on experience in building full stack web applications.

I find fulfillment in solving problems using logical thinking and I am looking forward to take on a career where I can use my analytical mindset and sensibility for clean design to contribute to a meaningful project and expand my knowledge in web development.

## Skills

#### Responsibility and accountability

I take ownership for the work I do on my own and as part of a team, accepting accountability for the results. At Proctor and Matthews Architects, I was responsible for the construction detailed design of [John Dower House](https://www.proctorandmatthews.com/project/john-dower-house-cheltenham), contributing to the final completion of the building while managing a professional relationship with the contractor.

#### Sustained focus and precision in reviewing technical information

Able to stay focused for long hours and have the necessary patience to review technical information. At my previous job, I checked sub-contractors drawings and specifications of a multi-residential project at construction stage, and my overall accuracy assisted the contractor with the delivery of a quality product.

#### Indipendent learning and interdisciplinary approach

Eager to learn new skills and develop my personal knowledge. Over the last two years, I have picked up several programming languages for different purposes, like python to automate boring stuff at my previous job and javascript to create interactive generative artworks in the browser.

## Interests

#### Generative Art

I discovered the field of [generative art](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art) while learning to code on my own and became captivated by this, experimenting with p5.js and processing, and sharing my work on [openprocessing.org](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/157729).

#### Music

I have been playing the piano since the age of five and music has always been integral to my life. The habit of practicing and composing pieces of music has tought me how to concentrate for long hours and build a balanced and grounded mindset. In June 2009 I received the piano diploma from the Conservatory of Ancona, Italy.

#### Chess

I enjoy playing chess and following tournaments on-line, as I am fascinated by the math and algorithms hidden within the rules of the game.

#### Sports

I am inspired by sport stories and people, from which I have learned so much in terms of respect, self-esteem and personal development. My favourite sports to watch are rugby and tennis, while to practice are swimming and cycling.
