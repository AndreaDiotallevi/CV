## Andrea Diotallevi

I am a full-stack software engineer, fascinated by how widely code is embedded in almost everything we do, making it ever more efficient and accessible.


Over the last two years, I have gained hands-on experience building full stack web applications within an agile development environment, as well as working on side projects


I have been working on personal projects like generative art, gaining hands-on experience with different type of programming languages.

gaining hands-on experience in building full stack web apps (see...), object-oriented programming (see...), testing best practices (see...) and generative art (see...).

In addition, my background in building engineering and architecture has helped me develop teamwork, design and development skills that can be successfully applied in a software engineering company.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy, London (October 2019 - January 2020)

*Full Stack Development*  

- 16 weeks honing my skills as a full-stack software engineer.
- Promoting TDD, DRY, OOP, MVC, clean code, teamwork, respect, mindfulness, and acceptance.
- Time for self-driven work allows us to focus on area we believe we most need improvement, or to pursue interests that may not be part of the standard curriculum.
- Multiple group projects simulate real-world, team-work environments with stand-ups, retros, sprint-planning, task delegation, and most of all thoughtful communication.
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Polytechnic University of Ancona, Italy (September 2008 - December 2014)

- Master's degree in building engineering and architecture (110/110 with honors)

#### Conservatory of Ancona, Italy (March 2002 - June 2009)

- Piano diploma (10/10)

## Experience

**Proctor and Matthews Architects** (March 2015 to September 2019)    
*Architect*  
- I have built python scripts to automate some boring stuff like renaming multiple files with correct revision letter.

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
