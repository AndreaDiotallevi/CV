## Overview

I am a **full-stack software engineer**, with a background in building engineering and architecture, having worked for the last four and a half years as an architect at [Proctor & Matthews](https://www.proctorandmatthews.com/), where I contributed to the construction of a [70-unit residential complex](https://www.proctorandmatthews.com/project/john-dower-house-cheltenham). Working with cloud and design technologies within the architectural industry is where I came to learn I had much stronger affinity towards the software side of my work, where I was looking into ways to automate time-consuming tasks with code.

Ever since gaining exposure to programming, through practising with different data structures and algorithms with Python, I became hooked into coding. I spoke to developers about the industry and started **self-learning** for about a year and a half before taking the leap and investing into my future with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a 16-week software development bootcamp, in which I rapidly increased my skills as a developer using principles such as TDD, DRY, OOP, and XP values and getting hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications.

As a self-learner, I have also been exploring technologies across different disciplines, like creating [generative artworks](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art) with JavaScript and scraping data from web pages with Python. Having a varied professional background and interests, I hope to leverage the different experiences I have gained to support the development of my colleagues, the company and myself.

## Skills

#### Responsibility and accountability

I take ownership for the work I do on my own and as part of a team, accepting accountability for the results. At Proctor and Matthews Architects, I was responsible for the construction detailed design of [John Dower House](https://www.proctorandmatthews.com/project/john-dower-house-cheltenham), contributing to the final completion of the building while managing a professional relationship with the contractor.

#### Sustained focus and precision in reviewing technical information

Able to stay focused for long hours and have the necessary patience to review technical information. At my previous job, I checked sub-contractors drawings and specifications of a multi-residential project at construction stage, and my overall accuracy assisted the contractor with the delivery of a quality product.

#### Indipendent learning and interdisciplinary approach

Eager to learn new skills and develop my personal knowledge. Over the last two years, I have picked up several programming languages for different purposes, like python to automate boring stuff at my previous job and javascript to create interactive generative artworks in the browser.

## Education

## Interests

#### Generative Art

I discovered the field of [generative art](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art) while learning to code on my own and became captivated by this, experimenting with p5.js and processing, and sharing my work on [openprocessing.org](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/157729).

#### Music

I have been playing the piano since the age of five, and music has always been integral to my life. The habit of practicing and composing pieces of music has tought me how to concentrate for long hours and build a balanced and grounded mindset. In June 2009 I received the piano diploma from the Conservatory of Ancona, Italy.

#### Chess

I enjoy playing chess and following tournaments on-line, as I am fascinated by the math and algorithms hidden within the rules of the game.

#### Sports

I am inspired by sport stories and people, from which I have learned so much in terms of respect, self-esteem and personal development. My favourite sports to watch are rugby and tennis, while to practice are swimming and cycling.
